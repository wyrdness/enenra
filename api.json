      "full": "The Enenra is a relatively obscure Japanese yokai that takes the form of smoke or vapor. Unlike most yokai, it has no solid physical form and exists entirely as smoke, constantly shifting and changing shape. The Enenra typically manifests in smoke rising from wood fires, bonfires, or fireplaces, sometimes taking vague human shapes within the smoke. According to folklore, the Enenra is generally neutral rather than malevolent, and can only be seen by individuals who are pure of heart or those who are fated to die soon. The creature embodies the ephemeral and impermanent nature of existence, serving as a living metaphor for the transient quality of life itself. In modern popular culture, the Enenra has gained recognition through the Mortal Kombat character Smoke, who possesses smoke-based powers inspired by this yokai."
